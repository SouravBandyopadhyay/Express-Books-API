# Simple Express API Project

## Overview

This is a simple Express API project that allows you to manage resources with basic CRUD operations. It connects to MongoDB for data storage and is easy to set up.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Node.js** (version 20.15.0 or later)
- **MongoDB** (can be local or cloud-based)

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-express-api.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file, like so:

    ```dotenv
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://your-username:your-password@host:port/database
    PORT=3000
    ```

4. Run the app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The API will be live at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Endpoints

- `GET /api/resources`: Get all resources
- `POST /api/resources`: Create a new resource
- `GET /api/resources/:id`: Get a specific resource by ID
- `PUT /api/resources/:id`: Update a resource by ID
- `DELETE /api/resources/:id`: Delete a resource by ID
